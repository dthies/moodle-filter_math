moodle-filter_math
=================

This plugin implements a fronted filter for local_math image generator. It
scans texts to find math scripts, caches scripts for local_math plugin to
find, and insert appropriate tags in place of the script.  This provides
an effective replacement for the TeX notation filter and provides a lot
of other functionality for mathematics display.
